1.Which partial linear spaces are self dual.
-Use automorphism group.

2. Embedding in a classical projective plane.
-Over Which Characteristics

3. Embedding in a non-classical plane.

4. finite planes moorhouse website

5. Not exhaustive subsets of planes but random selection
	-just random will be too sparse
	-want subsets to be as connected as possible
	-look for saturated ones (condition for saturation)?

6. Randomization Theory (randomized search)
- can use C random generator 

Avoid Trivial Things
-Choose large automorphism group

7. Use pappus configuration, Desargues 

8. Which SPLS have the nicest automorphism groups (before embedaility)

9. For embedding, use grobner basis methods??
